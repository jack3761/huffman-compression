The main function in this code runs to have the option to compress a file, decompress or run the example.

The example is designed to be ran on this computer so therefore will not run without the code itself being
edited on the testing computer.

It is important that the file name for compression is just put as the text file with the file path being the
directory of the folder that said text file is in.

eg fileName = "bible.txt"
filePath = "C:\Uni Work\Data structures and algorithms\src\"

With these inputed correctly, the program will compress the text file to a new output_file.bin.


For decompression, the full directory should be inputted

eg wrapperFileName = "C:\Uni Work\Data structures and algorithms\output_file.bin"


If this code is unable to run for whatever reason, it is suggested to adjust the example section
in the java file and hardcode the String variables to the correct file path. A textfile bible.txt can be
found in the src folder as an example
